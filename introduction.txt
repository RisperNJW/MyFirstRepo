About Myself 
I’m a curious and committed developer shaped by my journey through ALX and the projects I’ve built along the way. 
I love turning ideas into structured, meaningful digital experiences.
What drives me is growth, creativity, and the desire to build solutions that feel purposeful and human. 
Every project has made me better, more confident, and more visionary about the kind of builder I’m becoming.
